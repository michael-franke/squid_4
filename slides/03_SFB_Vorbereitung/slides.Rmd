# processing

## incremental & predicitive processing

<span style = "color:firebrick">processing</span>

- comprehension of serially presented written or oral language input in context


<span style = "color:firebrick">incrementality</span>

- build a syntactic & semantic representations as the sentence comes in
    
    - how to deal with ambiguity? singular guess or parallel hypotheses?

<span style = "color:firebrick">predicitive</span>

- minimal sense: processing behavior is a function of current state

- strong(est) sense: comprehender entertains hypotheses about the future

## expectation-based syntactic processing accounts

- basic premiss: anticipation is an advantage also for linguistic material
- (maximally) predictive interpreter has <span style = "color:firebrick">lexico-syntactic expecations</span> $P(w_1, \dots, w_n \mid c)$
    - operationalized by corpus frequencies of relevant structures
    - possible beam-search approximation
    - derived expectation about continuation $P(w_{i+1}, \dots, w_n \mid w_1, \dots, w_i, c)$

- <span style = "color:firebrick">processing difficulty</span> linked to distance between $P(\cdot \mid  w_1, \dots, w_i, c)$ and  $P(\cdot \mid w_1, \dots, w_{i+1}, c)$
    - self-paced reading times (Smith & Levy 2013)
    - N400 amplitude (Frank et al. 2015)

# rational pragmatic processors

## rational speech act model

<span style = "color:firebrick">literal listener</span> picks literal interpretation (uniformly at random):

$$ P_{LL}(t \mid m) \propto P(t \mid [\![m]\!]) $$

<span style = "color:firebrick">Gricean speaker</span> approximates informativity-maximization:

$$ P_{S}(m \mid t) \propto \exp( \lambda P_{LL}(t \mid m)) $$

<span style = "color:firebrick">pragmatic listener</span> uses Bayes' rule to infer likely world states:

$$ P_L(t \mid m ) \propto P(t) \cdot P_S(m \mid t) $$

<span style = "color:white"> &nbsp; </span>

## incremental & predicitive interpretation

- messages are word sequences: $\messg = w_1, \dots, w_n$

- initial subsequence of $\messg$: $\messg_{\rightarrow i} = w_1, \dots w_i$

- all messages sharing initial subsequence: $\Messgs(\messg_{\rightarrow i}) = \set{\messg' \in \Messgs \mid \messg'_{\rightarrow i} =
  \messg_{\rightarrow i}}$

- <span style = "color:firebrick">next-word expectation</span>:

$$P_L(w_{i+1} \mid \messg_{\rightarrow i}) \propto \sum_{\state} P(\state) \ \sum_{\messg' \in
    \Messgs(\messg_{\rightarrow i}, w_{i+1})} P_S(\messg' \mid \state)$$

- <span style = "color:firebrick">interpretation evidence</span>:

$$P_L(\state \mid \messg_{\rightarrow i}) \propto P(\state) \ \sum_{\messg' \in
    \Messgs(\messg_{\rightarrow i})} P_S(\messg' \mid \state)$$

## design

<span style = "color:firebrick">procedure</span>

- picture (1500ms) -> sentence (500ms per word) -> truth-value judgement

<span style = "color:firebrick"> sentence material </span>

- "Alle/Einige$_1$ Punkte sind blau$_2$, die im Kreis/Quadrat$_3$ sind"
- "All/some of the dots in the circle/square are blue/red"

<span style = "color:firebrick">visual stimuli</span>

## computational-level rational processing

\textcolor{blue}{general assumptions}

- listener expects speaker to make a pragmatically felicitous utterance
- listener does not give up on speaker rationality on the way (charity, forward induction, ...)


\textcolor{blue}{experimental microcosmos assumption}

- possible meanings $\States$: pairs of contexts ($A$ - $D$) and speaker-intended shape
- possible messages $\Messgs$: "All/some dots are blue/red that are in the square/circle."

\textcolor{blue}{specific assumptions}

- listener knows context, but not shape
- speaker chooses description for context and shape

## next-word expectations vs. N400

- incremental RSA predicts $P_L(w_{i+1} \mid w_{1,\dots,i}, c)$
- correlating predicted next-word expectations grand-average early N400 (300-400ms):
    - $r= 0.44$, $p < 0.01$ in total
    - $r = 0.81$, $p < 0.001$ after exclusion of unexpected continuations
